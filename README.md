# Student-Gradebook

## **📖 Description**
The Student Gradebook System is a simple Python program that allows users to:

    - View a list of students and their grades
    - Search for a specific student’s grade
    - Update a student’s grade
    - Display the updated gradebook
    - Identify the student with the highest grade
This project demonstrates the use of Python dictionaries, loops, conditional statements, and user input handling.

## **🧠 Features**
    ✅ Display all students and their grades
    ✅ Search for a student’s grade by name
    ✅ Update an existing student’s grade
    ✅ Show the updated gradebook after modification
    ✅ Determine and display the top-performing student

## **💻 How It Works**

1. The program initializes a dictionary named gradebook containing student names and grades.
2. It displays all student names and their corresponding grades.
3. The user is prompted to search for a student by name to view their grade.
4. The user can then update a student’s grade if the student exists in the gradebook.
5. The updated gradebook is displayed.
6. Finally, the program identifies and prints the top student based on the highest grade.
